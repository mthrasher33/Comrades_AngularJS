The project was bootstrapped with <a href="http://yeoman.io/">Yeoman's Angular generator</a> and uses Angular's MVW framework to render locally hosted JSON data in an attractive, speedy manner. <a href=https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngRoute>Angular-Route.js</a> increases application efficiency by generating views without page reloads.</p> <a href=https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass>Bootstrap-SASS</a> handles the CSS3 (with animations sprinkled in), and controller-side calculations to determine comrade match strength are all done via functional JavaScript programming. The app is hosted via <a href="https://dashboard.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> and available on <a href=https://github.com/mthrasher33/Comrades_AngularJS>GitHub</a>.If you have any feedback on the project, send us a pull request on GitHub or <a href="mailto:matthew.j.thrasher@gmail.com?subject=Comrades!
